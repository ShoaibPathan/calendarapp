# Calendar App
An attempt is made to build a calendar app. I have taken some deviations in the design screenshots that are given as a reference for the task. Due to time constrains App is partially completed. Given one more week time I will make an attemp add few more features.

As mentioned in the requirements I have made an attempt to build the app without any storyboards and XIBs

##Completed Functionalities
* Calendar View
* Agenda/Appointments View

##To-Do
* Tap a date and view agenda/appointments
* Add an agenda/appointment
* Weather Information
* UI Test Cases Not Included (Manually Tested)

##Scope Of Improvements
* UI Enhancements
* Reusable Code. Due to time Constrains couldn't architect in a satisfactory way.

##Time Logger
* On an average daily I have logged one hour for development of App. Appriximately I have logged 14 -18 hours.
